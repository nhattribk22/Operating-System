In order to aid students in understanding the fundamentals of scheduling, synchronization, and memory management, this source code emulates a basic operating system. The general architecture of the operating system that we use is depicted in the figure below. The operating system will use two main components to handle two virtual resources, CPU and RAM:
- Scheduler and Dispatcher
- The engine of virtual memory (VME) <br />
